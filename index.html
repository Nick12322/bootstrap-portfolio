                    <p> My name is Nicholas Woodward, and I am a 22 year old full-stack MERN developer currently in a web development
                        bootcamp run at UCSD. I have a passion for technology and computing, and always have since my parents
                        bought our first family computer (an old Hewlett-Packard running Windows ME) from best buy when I
                        was about 5 years old. As I became older and more exposed to programming via computer games (mainly
                        through the steam source engine, World of Warcraft addons, and playing with flash game scripting
                        in the console) my curiousity grew.
                    </p>

                    <p> Today many of my passions remain the same. I still enjoy playing Vanilla World of Warcraft on a private
                        server, and I still enjoy playing Counter Strike. My passion and interest in flash games, however,
                        has waned markedly. I choose to fill that hole today with movies, (favorites include There Will be
                        Blood, No Country for Old Men and, if you'll count it as a movie, Dave Chappelle's first standup
                        special, Killin' 'em Softly) television, (favorites include the Sopranos, and Breaking Bad) and music
                        (favorites include The Velvet Underground, Father John Misty, and Belle and Sebastian).
                    </p>

                    <p> My first real exposure to programming began with a book called "Python Crash Course" by Eric Mathes.
                        From the first day I bought it, I was immediately intrigued, and found programming not only challenging,
                        but interesting and fun. The feeling of achievement upon completing a project was incredible. I look
                        to learn as much as possible when undertaking new projects, from sources online, in-person, and through
                        simply slamming my head into a brick wall from time to time. I am proficient in HTML, CSS (including
                        bootstrap), JavaScript (including Jquery), and have some knowledge in Firebase, node.js and Python.
